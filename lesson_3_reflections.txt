When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Remote repository will be used when I need to share and cowork with others.It would also be useful as a backup.
  
  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork helps us create a copy of a repository within GitHub.Clones help us to 
    copy repositories from Github to our computer and within the computer locally. 
    Branches are a way of creating a copy of a repository within our local computer.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It helps us to work offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Cloud storage could be used, but it would be difficult when conflicts arise 
    while merging code.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When working in a team,experimenting on a new feature,solving a bug,etc, a 
    separate branch is more appropriate.
    
    Working on a separate branch will preserve the master in case our experiments 
    do not go well.Work on the master will free us from the task of merging our
    code, which has to be done in the case of working on a separate branch.
    
    We could make our changes directly to the master branch, but when contributing to 
    a public repository, itâ€™s standard practice to make the changes in a non-master 
    branch. This way, we can easily keep our master branch up-to-date with master of 
    the original repository, and merge changes from master into our branch when we are ready.
